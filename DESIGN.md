# Design notes

## Problem
Volunteer organisers (para puja committees, college fest teams, families) plan with scattered chats and memory.
They need a budget that adds up, a deadline for each job, the right questions to ask vendors, and a fast way to see
what breaks when something slips.

## Decisions

| Decision | Why | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Plan computed in the browser by `core.js` | Instant, works offline, exact; the same file is tested in Node | The server and browser must agree, so both load the same file |
| AI only for ideas, tips and wording | Models are weak at arithmetic and dates; wording is where they help | Less "magic", more trust |
| Strict JSON answer + validation + sanitising | Never render raw model output | A malformed answer falls back to templates |
| Template fallback with a visible reason | The app is useful with no key, no quota or no network, and the user can see why | Templates are less personal |
| Model list tried in order, overridable by env | Model names change often | Slightly more code |
| No dependencies, no build | Small repo, nothing to patch, deploys anywhere | Hand-written DOM code |
| Strict CSP, `textContent` only | Removes the main XSS routes | Styles/scripts must be separate files |
| Flat file layout + one-line `api/assist.js` | Easy to upload from a phone | `assist-handler.js` is also served as a static file (it contains no secrets) |

## Data flow
1. The browser validates the form with `core.validateInput` and builds the plan with `core.buildPlan`.
2. It sends the validated request (plus its own calendar day) to `POST /api/assist`.
3. The server validates again, rebuilds the plan, builds a prompt (instructions separate from quoted user data), asks Gemini
   for JSON, parses and cleans it, and returns it. On any failure it returns the template answer instead.
4. Re-planning (`core.applyChange`) never calls the server; "refresh AI advice" is an explicit button.

## Scheduling rules
* Each template task has a lead time (days before the event) and dependencies. A task is never due before a task it depends on.
* If there is less time than the template needs, all lead times are scaled down proportionally (order is preserved).
* A delay moves a task later; dependents move only if they run out of slack. A task landing after the event date is flagged.

## Testing strategy
Pure logic is tested exhaustively (every preset, every template invariant, many budgets). The API is tested with a fake
`fetch`, covering each failure mode and hostile input. The interface was exercised in a real browser at phone widths with the
production Content-Security-Policy turned on.

## Known limits
* The rate limiter is per warm instance, not global.
* Budget presets and thresholds are heuristics.
* Gemini output quality varies; the notes field is treated as untrusted but no model is injection-proof, which is why the
  output is sanitised and cannot execute anything.
